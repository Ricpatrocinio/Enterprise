# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Models

This repository contains two versions of a machine learning model developed for diagnosing breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## Models

### 1. Random Forest Classifier (Version 1)

The first version of the model uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features of cell nuclei present in a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest
- **Accuracy:** [Include accuracy score]
- **Dependencies:** pandas, scikit-learn

### 2. Support Vector Machine (Version 2)

The second version of the model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve the same goal as the first version.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is used for training and testing the models. The dataset contains 569 instances with 32 attributes, including the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) and 30 real-valued input features.
